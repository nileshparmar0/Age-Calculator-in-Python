# Age-Calculator-in-Python

Overview:

This Python script calculates a person's age in years, months, and days based on their date of birth. By prompting the user for their birth year, month, and day, the script computes the exact age by comparing the birth date with the current date.


Features:

• Validates the input to ensure the birth date is not in the future.
• Calculates the age in a precise format: years, months, and days.
• Handles invalid input gracefully, prompting the user to enter valid integers for the date of birth.

Requirements:
• Python 3.x

Usage: 
1. Clone the Repository or Download the Script:
   • You can clone the repository using the following command:
   bash code: git clone https://github.com/your-username/age-calculator.git
2. Run the Script:
   • Open a terminal or command prompt.
   • Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
   • Run the script using the Python interpreter:
     bash code: python age_calculator.py
3. Input the Birth Date:
   • When prompted, enter the birth year, month, and day as integers.
   • Example:
   Age Calculator By Python:
     Enter the birth year: 1990
     Enter the birth month: 5
     Enter the birth day: 21
4. View the Calculated Age:
   • The script will output the calculated age in the format: "Age: X years, Y months, and Z 
     days".
   • Example output:
     Age: 34 years, 2 months, and 1 day


• Logic:
1. Get today's date.
2. Check if the birth date is in the future.
3. Calculate if the birthday has occurred this year.
4. Calculate the difference in years.
5. Calculate the remaining months until the next birthday.
6. Calculate the remaining days until the next birthday.
7. Return the age as a formatted string.
